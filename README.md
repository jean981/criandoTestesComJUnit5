# 🚀 Unit Testing with JUnit

Hey there! Welcome to this repository where you'll find quick and easy tutorials on how to test your code using **JUnit** — a must-have skill for any developer who wants to build reliable software and sleep peacefully after deploying. 😴✨

## 1. Why Should You Test Your Code? 🔍

### 1.1. What Are Software Tests?

A software test is basically code that checks other code. It makes sure that everything behaves as expected — either by verifying the final result (**state testing**) or by checking the sequence of actions (**behavior testing**). 🏆

### 1.2. Why Are They Useful?

Imagine tweaking your code and only finding out later that you broke something. Not cool, right? 😬  
Automated tests help catch issues early, save time, and give you confidence to keep adding new features without worrying about breaking stuff. With good test coverage, you’ll spend less time manually clicking through everything just to make sure it still works. 🛡️

## 2. Testing Lingo You Should Know 💬

### 2.1. Code Under Test

This is the code you’re testing. If you’re testing a full application, we call it the *application under test*.

### 2.2. Test Fixture

A test fixture is the setup or starting point needed to run a test. Think of it like setting the stage before the show starts. 🎭  
It could be a specific value, an object, or any input that the test depends on to run correctly.

### 2.3. Unit Tests

A unit test focuses on a small piece of your code — usually a single method or class.  
It checks if that piece works as expected in isolation. To avoid external interference, we often replace real dependencies with *mocks* or test versions of objects. 🧪

> Quick tip: unit tests aren’t great for complex UIs or multi-component flows. For that, you’ll want...

### 2.4. Integration Tests

Integration tests check if different parts of your system play well together.  
They simulate real-world interactions and verify that everything works end-to-end — great for turning user stories into automated checks. 🧩

### 2.5. Performance Tests

These are all about speed and resilience. They check how your code performs under pressure, making sure it can handle heavy loads without breaking a sweat. 🚦
